    <h1>Finding the right design for your ears</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> In-ear Design</li>
      <p>You might know them by various names like earbuds, in-ear headphones, these are the smallest and most portable type of earphones. They rest in the bowl of the ear, outside the ear canal, though a portion might extend into the canal. They have foam or rubber tips to give you comfort.</p>
      <p>Some models, particularly sports centric ones, come equipped with wings or fins for a tailored and secure fit. These insert-style models when inserted into the canals often form a seal that can help keep out the extraneous noise. They are extremely popular these days due to their stylish looks and convenience.</p>
      <p>Talking about the benefits of this design - the first thing that comes to the mind is their small size and hence the portability they offer. You can stuff them in your pockets or carry them in your palm. They don’t mess up your hair or interfere with your glasses or earrings! You can carry them effortlessly and always be at your stylish best!</p>
      <li>Ear Clip Design</li>
      <p>If you are looking for a middle ground between huge and bulky headphones and extremely compact and portable earbuds, then ear-clip design earphones are meant for you. In a lot of ways they carry the best of both.</p>
  <p>These headphones are compact and have ear-loops to keep them in place. Mind you they are not like having ear tips, but a complete feature hook that fits over the ears and connects to your music device via Bluetooth or audio jack. This makes them easier to carry around than heavy headphones and more comfortable than earbuds.</p>
<p>On-ear clip-on headphones bestow protection to the user from different kinds of gory bacteria that might enter the ear canal and lead to infections.</p>   
<li>Behind the Neck Design</li>
<p>We are sure you have already seen people wearing these high-tech collars with headphones sprouting out the sides. They go around with different names like - neckband headphones, collar headphones or even behind the neck headphones.</p>
<p>This distinctive style of design offers them multiple advantages. The first major advantage is quite an obvious one, but still worth pointing out - they are always around whenever you want them. Given that the earbuds are hanging around your neck, mere inches away from your ears, you won’t have to dig through your bag or pockets when you want to listen to your favorite tune or take a call.</p>
<p>Apart from this, they also come with many surprises like convenient controls, better mics that are nearer to the mouth, and bigger batteries. In the end, they say ‘I am on the go’ or ‘I am active’ and add that extra edge to your personality - Neckbands vs TWS: What Do You Need?</p>
